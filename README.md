ETS2MP Localization
===================

ETS2MP php files that contains translations to many languages. You can contribute your own language.

When my localization will be added to website?
===================
As soon as possible - I don't have time to check github every minute and update all localizations real time.

How to translate?
===================

1. Create a new branch and check it out
2. **Copy** the ```en``` folder to your ISO 639-1 shortcode (eg. Polish is pl, Norwegian BokmÃ¥l is nb, English is en, etc. these can be found on eg. wikipedia in the infobox on the side)
3. Translate all messages to your langauge keep this format:
```
'key' => 'message',
```

Sometimes you will encounter something like this:
```
'ban_too_new' => 'Please wait until :date UTC to create an appeal.',
```
In this case you should translate everything except ```:date``` this is a special keyword.

Other times you might encounter
```
'registration_body' => array(
    'pre_link'      => 'Already signed up? Click ',
    'link'          => 'Sign in',
    'post_link'     => 'to login to your account.',
),
```
this is used when there's a link in a sentence, you should only change the message in the pre_link, link and post_link parts, these appears before, inside and after the link.

Remember: Do not change key. Change only "message".

If you have more questions feel free to ask send them to me:

Have fun.
